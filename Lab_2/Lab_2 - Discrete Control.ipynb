    "PyTorch is a popular open-source machine learning library that provides efficient tensor computation and automatic differentiation, making it well-suited for deep reinforcement learning (DRL) tasks. It offers a flexible and intuitive programming model that allows for easy construction of complex neural network architectures commonly used in DRL, such as convolutional and recurrent networks. Additionally, PyTorch supports GPU acceleration, which can greatly speed up training and inference for DRL models (though in this lab we won't need to make use of the GPU's).\n",

I also added an example of doing the same calculation wrapper in a `torch.no_grad()`, as this will kill any gradient computations -- we will see later that this can be useful.

    "The `MLP` class is network class. Whenever creating a PyTorch network you should always ensure the class is a child class of the `nn.Module`; the main reason being that whenever we assign an optimiser to the network it will know exactly which parameters to optimise, which is any layer we define in the `init` that comes from the `torch.nn` module. Our network only makes use of the `nn.Linear` layer, which is essentially a single linear transformation to the data: $y = xW^T + b$ where $x$ is the input data, $W$ is the learnable set of weights, and $b$ is the (also learnable) bias. Another popular layer that we won't use in this lab is the convolutional layer, `nn.Conv2d`, which applies a convolutional layer.\n",

    "As for the specific architecture of our network, we see that it has one hidden layer with a `relu` activation in the middle layer. To apply the `relu` activation function, we just use the built in `torch.relu` function to the output of our linear layer -- autograd will handle all the gradient calculations so we don't need to worry about doing anything else! Note that we don't need to apply any activation to our output layer. The reason for this being that the `nn.CrossEntropyLoss` expect a vector of *logit* values, so we don't need to normalise these into probabilities when using this loss function, so keep this in mind as in future we may want our output to have certain values e.g. non-negative or log-probabilities, in which case we will have to apply a relevant transformation such as the `torch.relu` or `torch.log_softmax`!\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have defined the network, all that is left to do is define the loss function we wish to use (as mentioned above, this is the `CrossEntropyLoss`, but the `nn` module has other common losses such as `MSELoss`) and also an optimiser. A PyTorch optimiser is a built in gradient descent method. For this example we are using  the [Adam](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980) optimiser which most Deep RL algorithms use. Using an optimiser is very simple -- we simply call the optimiser we want to use and pass as an argument the networks parameters; to find our networks parameters we can use `mlp.parameters()` to return an iterable. Let's see how we do this in practice: "

    "### Now that we have had a look at the environment we will be using, let's define our Q-Network\n",
    "As mentioned, the Q-Network will replace our table look-up of Q-values. Indeed, rather than maintain a table for every state-action pair, we will learn a function $Q_\\theta: \\mathcal{S} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{A}|}$ where $\\theta$ are the learnable parameters. Note that we pass in only the state, rather than a state and action, and receive a Q-value for each action. Whilst it would also work to pass state and action as input and receive a scalar, this way we can obtain value estimates for the entire action space with a single forward pass of the network, and this is typically how we will define our input-outputs for our function approximations in discrete action space MDPs. Now onto the code:"

    "You might find the amount of arguments for the above class a bit overwhelming, as there are a lot of hyperparameters to consider (sadly this is true for all RL...) so we can go through them one by one. `state_dim`, `action_dim` and `hidden_size` should hopefully be self explanatory. `batch_size` is the amount of data we want to sample from the replay buffer for each learning step. `gamma` corresponds to the discount factor. `tau` corresponds to the rate at which we update our target network parameters (more on this shortly), `max_memory` is the maximum size of our replay buffer, `epsilon_min` is the minimum $\\epsilon$ that we want for our $\\epsilon$-greedy policy, with `exploration_decay` being the rate at which we decay `epsilon`. Finally, `lr` is the learning rate we use for our Q-Network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's look at the methods one-by-one. First, the `act` and `greedy_act` methods are almost identical, except `act` allows for exploration and is what should be used during training, `greedy_act` should be used for testing. In `act`, we first draw a number from a $\\mathcal{U}(0, 1)$ distribution and if the number is less than $\\epsilon$, we take an exploratory action. We initialise $\\epsilon$ to be 1, and decay it with every exploratory action we take, up to some minimum value. This is so that early during training we are exploring heavily, whereas as training goes on we should be exploiting more often than not. If we don't take an exploratory action, then we need to obtain our q-values by first creating a tensor from the numpy state and performing a forward pass of the network. Once we have our q-values, we can find the `.argmax()` of the Q-values and return this as the action to take. \n",
    "\n",
    "The next few methods are mainly just to keep things tidy -- in `get_batch` we sample from our buffer and then loop through the batch and put all the states, actions, etc. onto their own tensors to be used in the `experience_replay` method -- note how we have used a `LongTensor` for the actions, since these are strictly integer values; this is useful as we can index tensors with integers, but not floats. `update_target` updates our target network parameters (which were originally an exact copy of our initial network) by using a Polyak-average: $w'_{new} = w \\times \\tau + w'_{old} \\times (1 - \\tau)$, where $w$ are the weights of the online network and $w'$ are the weights of the target network. We make use of a target network to stabilise learning, since the target for the Q-values are bootstrapped from their own estimate, which can lead to instabilities if we update without a target network, and so we should update our target network each time that we used gradient descent to update our online network. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the `load/save_model` simply save the PyTorch objects for the online and target network. **You should now try and write your own code for the** `experience_replay` **method.** Here is a list of things it will need to do:\n",
    "1. Use the `get_batch` method to return your `state`, `action`, `reward`, `next_state`, and `done` tensors;\n",
    "2. Perform a forward pass of the network to get the online Q-Values (**Hint:** the output of the network will be a tensor of size $(B, |\\mathcal{A}|)$, where $B$ is the batch size, i.e. a vector of Q-values for each state in the batch. For each state we only care about the q-value for the ***action that was taken***. To get these specific Q-values, you might find the `tensor.gather()` method useful, used with the `action` tensor as the indices. Read the [PyTorch documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.gather.html) to see how this works.\n",
    "3. Obtain the targets -- this will include doing a forward pass of the network on the *next states*, and bootstrapping the values similar to how we did in the Tabular case. Be careful to make sure that you use the `torch.no_grad()` to stop any gradients computations when calculating the target! **Note**: make sure to use the target network to compute the targets;\n",
    "4. `zero_grad` the optimiser, calculate the loss (optionally you can store this in the `self.loss` list so that you can plot the loss later, useful for debugging), backpropagate and perform a gradient descent step.\n",
    "5. Update the target network. It is also useful to keep track of how many gradient steps we have made, so don't forget to increment the `self.grad_steps` variable each time an update is made.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have implemented the `experience_replay` method, try training your DQN using the below training loop. Note that the first training loop is just to populate the buffer to a minimum size of transitions from a random policy, so that the DQN has some examples to learn from straight away -- this is common with off-policy methods. We will track our DQN by the number of grad steps that we take; in RL it is common to test the performance of an RL algorithm by testing it against the number of grad steps it has taken. Another popular alternative is how many environment interactions it has had, but since we do an update for every interaction, these are the same here. I have initialised the DQN below with the hyperparameters I used to train the CartPole network we used earlier, but feel free to play around with these if you like. Training may take too long (around 5-15 mins on my machine) for the lab so you might want to read ahead and try training in your own time. "

    "In the training loop, we run some test episodes every 1000 gradient steps, to assess the performance of the DQN. We print the test score, and also the value of epsilon -- I find this useful as it allows us to check what the current exploration rate is, so it can help us tune it if we see that epsilon has decayed too quickly. We might also want to plot how the performance changes with the gradient steps; you can write some code to plot the information we stored in the `dqn_test_scores`.

    "Since the original DQN paper was released, many improvements have been proposed. In the paper [Rainbow: Combining Improvements in Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.02298) they consolidate these improvements into a single algorithm. Choose one of the improvements and try and implement this. (This may be something to do after the lab, time depending). **Note:** I would recommend Double DQN or using a prioritised replay buffer, as these will be the quickest to implement. Using a Distributional Critic I would recommend only if you want a challenge, as it requires the most involved changes. If you do try a prioritised replay buffer and read the original paper, you don't need to use the 'fancy' implementation that they mention; a simple list of priorities that you sample from using `np.random.choice` should suffice, though I recommend not using a buffer larger than 100k as the sampling will end up taking too long as the size of the buffer increases. (Another technique that people use that didn't make its way to the Rainbow paper is using $n$-step returns. I do find this to be useful, so consider implementing this too. Don't worry about off-policy corrections, in practice they aren't needed). \n",

    "# Policy Gradient methods\n",
    "Policy gradient methods are useful in reinforcement learning because they can learn directly from the policy distribution and optimise for non-differentiable reward functions. They also have the ability to learn stochastic policies and can handle continuous action spaces. Learning stochastic policies is particularly useful, since exploration is baked into the policy; though we still need to be careful that the exploration doesn't collapse. Since the introduction of the vanilla Policy Gradient, there are now a few different methods at our disposal. For now we will implement PPO for CartPole, and then later we will look at DDPG and Soft Actor-Critic for continuous action spaces. As a forewarning, I have chosen to look at PPO because I believe that you will get more out of it than looking at e.g. REINFORCE, as PPO is notoriously difficult to tune (see, for example, [this blog post!](https://iclr-blog-track.github.io/2022/03/25/ppo-implementation-details/)), so if your implementation does not work then don't worry, it is tricky!\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we start with the implementations, let's briefly remind ourselves of the objectives in PPO. To policy is trained to *maximise* the following: \n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_t\\left[\\min\\left(r_t(\\theta)A_t, \\mbox{clip}(r_t(\\theta), 1-\\epsilon, 1+\\epsilon)A_t \\right) \\right]\\; ;$$\n",
    "where $r_t(\\theta) = \\frac{\\pi_\\theta(a_t|s_a)}{\\pi_{\\theta_{old}}(a_t|s_t)}$, and $A_t = Q_\\pi(s, a) - V_\\pi(s)$ is the advantage. In practice PPO uses the [*Generalised Advantage Estimate* (GAE)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02438), which is what we will implement. The GAE uses a trade-off parameter between bias and variance to balance the estimation of the advantage function, allowing for faster and more stable learning -- for further details, see section 3. of the linked paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have looked at the objectives of PPO, let's try and implement them! We will need:\n",
    "1. A policy network and a value function network;\n",
    "2. A replay buffer -- this is different to the off-policy replay buffer we used with DQN. As PPO is on-policy, we have to empty the replay buffer after we have made updates with the data, plus there are also some extra quantities that we need to store;\n",
    "3. The policy and value function optimisation steps.\n",

We also used PyTorch's built in distributions so we can sample from a distribution proportional to our logits. `Categorical` takes as argument either `logits` or `probs`, but it is usually more convenient to pass in `logits` so that we don't have to normalise the distribution ourselves. \n",

    "First let's go through the hyper-parameters. I'll not repeat the ones which are the same as in the DQN. The new ones are: `gae_lambda`, which corresponds to the $\\lambda$ in the GAE calculation; `policy_clip` refers to the $\\epsilon$ value in the PPO objective; `n_epochs`, `batch_size`, `required_data` are all related to the data in the update -- `required_data` tells us how much data we need before do an update, `batch_size` tells us the size of the mini-batches to split the data in to, and `n_epochs` tells us how many times we will run through the data performing updates; `entropy_penalty` is the coefficient we penalise on the entropy to try and avoid a collapse in entropy. In practice, the objective that we maximise is actually \n",
    "$$\\mathcal{L}(\\theta) = \\mathbb{E}_t\\left[\\min\\left(r_t(\\theta)A_t, \\mbox{clip}(r_t(\\theta), 1-\\epsilon, 1+\\epsilon)A_t \\right) \\right] + k H_\\theta \\;;$$\n",
    "where $H_\\theta$ is the entropy of the policy and $k$ is the `entropy_penalty` coefficient. We also pass in the test environment to the PPO class, since we perform multiple updates per each time the `update` is called, it is easier to perform tests internally in the class, as opposed to the DQN class where we could perform the tests outside of the class. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `act` and `greedy_act` methods are very similar to those in DQN, except now we are given logit values and so we must sample from a distribution proportional to these values. For the `act` method, we also must return the log-probability, as this is needed for the update. In `greedy_act` we store the entropy to a list which we use when running the tests as a diagnostic to check the average entropy of the distribution, so we can monitor if the entropy has collapsed too early. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next we have the `update` method, where all the magic happens, but first we can look at the `get_batch_tensors`, `put_batch_to_tensors` and `generalized_advantage_estimate` methods, as they are all used in the `update` method. The first two are mainly for keeping things tidy -- the first simply gets tensors of indices that we can use to index our mini-batches in an epoch, and the latter will just put all the data from our PPO memory into tensors (this could optionally be moved to the PPO memory and called internally there). The latter calculated the GAE, and is an important step in getting PPO to work efficiently. Take some time to look at how this is calculated, and see if you can reconcile what is happening to the equation for the GAE from section 3 of the earlier linked paper. The method returns our estimate of the advantage and also the value target, which we use as the target for the value function. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the `update` method we loop over the number of epochs, and at each step we re-calculate the advantages and critic targets -- this is because the critic will be updated during the epoch and so we use the most up-to-date version to obtain the advantages and targets. You can try moving this outside of the for loop so that it is only calculated once to see how it effects performance -- it should be more efficient in terms of speed, so if it doesn't effect the final performance you might want to do this! Once we have calculated the critic targets and the advantages, we get our mini-batch indices and loop through each mini-batch of data performing the PPO update. This involves evaluating the log-probability for the state-action pairs in the mini-batch, calculating the clipped probability ratio (weighted by the advantage) and entropies, and calculating the loss. **Remember that we want to *maximise* the objective, and so we need to take a *negative* of the objective since PyTorch optimisers will by default perform gradient *descent*, when here we want to perform gradient *ascent***. We also calculate the critic loss, which should be similar to what we did in DQN by just minimising a squared error loss. Finally, we increment the `grad_steps` variable for each mini-batch update and obtain some test scores every 1000 updates. Recall that we are doing this internally, so we need to add the `run_test` function we wrote for the DQN into our class as a method. I am also saving the `(grad_steps, test_score)` to the `test_scores` variable of the PPO class, so that we can compare performance to the DQN. \n",
