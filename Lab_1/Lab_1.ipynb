It also provides a collection of diverse and challenging environments that can be used for benchmarking and testing new algorithms.\n",

    "The above loop is something you will see a lot whilst learning Reinforcement Learning, and is why the gym framework is a valuable asset as it allows us a simple, clean way of looping through episodes of an environment. Note that when we reset the environment, `env.reset()` will actually return two objects -- the `state` and `info` (which we assign to an unnamed variable). The `info` is there to tell us if there are any problems with the environment or any bits of information that may be useful, and is only really used for debugging if something is going wrong. It is also returned when calling `env.step()`, but for now we don't need to worry about it. \n",

This is not something we need to worry about for Blackjack, but in continuing problems (i.e. those with no terminal states), or those with very long time horizons, it can be useful to reset the environment whilst training before an episode ends. However, we don't want to treat this as a terminal state, and so the `terminated` flag is what we use to tell the algorithm whether or not the state is terminal, whereas the `truncated` flag is for our use in training to tell us whether or not we should reset the environment, so during training we now have two reset conditions: whether the state was truly terminal, or whether we are truncating the episode. \n",

One of the downsides of Monte Carlo learning is that we have to wait *until the end of an episode* before we receive any feedback about our actions. What if we don't want to wait this long? What if we are in a continuing task where there is no end to an episode? That is where TD Learning comes in, as rather than wait until the end of an episode to calculate the Monte Carlo returns, we simply bootstrap the remaining returns from our current estimate. The simplest example is the SARSA algorithm which makes the following update: $Q(s, a) \\leftarrow Q(s, a) + \\alpha \\left[ r(s, a) + \\gamma Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \\right]$, where $a'$ is an action which we sample from our current policy $\\pi$, i.e. $a' \\sim \\pi(\\cdot|s')$. We can see that our returns are calculated by bootstrapping the value from the next state $s'$, rather than waiting for the end of the episode.\n",

    "The code follows the general class structure as the Monte Carlo method (in general, it is good practice to find a layout for your classes that you like and stick to it, so that any algorithms you write and publish are more readable). The only real changes are in the `train` method and the `update_Q` method. In the latter, we have just changed our update rule to be that of the SARSA algorithm. In the former, we have changed slightly the order of things -- now we take an action with the initial state, and pass in the next state to the `update_Q` method. Other than that, things are pretty much as they were!\n",

    "We are now going to test our first off-policy algorithm, Q-Learning. This algorithm was seminal to making *deep* RL successful, and we will look at the deep variant in our next lab, but for now we will stick with the tabular version. The update rule is similar to SARSA: $Q(s, a) \\leftarrow Q(s, a) + \\alpha \\left[ r(s, a) + \\gamma \\max_{a'}Q(s', a') - Q(s, a) \\right]$. We still choose actions according to some exploratory policy, but the value we bootstrap from comes from the greedy policy. **Why is Q-Learning considered an off-policy algorithm?**\n",

    "### Double Q-Learning\n",
    "As you have seen in the lectures, Q-Learning suffers from a maximisation bias in the target: $r + \\max_{a'}Q(s', a')$. Particularly in MDPs with many actions, meaning we take a maximum over many estimates, this can lead to a positive bias. For example, we could be in a state where the true $Q(s, a)$ is zero for most of the actions, but our estimates will be distributed above and below zero. The estimates above zero lead to the positive bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome this, Double Q-Learning was introduced. In Double Q-Learning, we maintain two estimates of the Q-values, $Q_1(s, a)$ and $Q_2(s, a)$. Instead of updating both estimates using a transition from the episode, we flip a coin and if, say, the coin lands on heads, then the update is given by $Q_1(s, a) \\leftarrow Q_1(s, a) + \\alpha \\left[r + \\gamma Q_2\\left(s', \\arg\\max_{a'}Q_1(s', a')\\right) - Q_1(s, a) \\right]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**As an exercise, I'd like you to implement Double Q-Learning and compare it to Q-Learning in a test environment**. We can find the test environment in the `utils.py` file. The example is a simple toy example (taken frmo pg. 135 of the Sutton and Barto textbook). We have an MDP with two states, $A$ and $B$. In state $A$ we can take action left or right, both of which give 0 reward. The right action will lead to an immediate terminal state, whilst the left action will lead to state $B$. From state $B$, we have $N$ actions, all of which lead to a terminal state with reward drawn from a $\\mbox{Normal}(-0.1, 1)$ distribution. The optimal action is to take the right action. Below, I will provide a Q-Learning class (essentially the same as what we implemented previously, but the init will be different as the example is custom made and not a gym environment so we need to be careful when defining the Q-Table etc.). For the Double Q-Learning, implement your own child class -- you will need to add a second Q-Table and change the update and act method."
